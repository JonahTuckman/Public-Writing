# Public-Writing
Writing that finds itself to either be polished enough to be public, or raw to the point that its imperfections are of little focus.

Private-Writing repo also exists, and is private as the name would suggest. When writing feels ready for eyes other than my own I will duplicate it and bring it into here.
